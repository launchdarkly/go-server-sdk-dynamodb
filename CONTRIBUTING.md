## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites
 
The library should be built against Java 1.13 or higher. It is meant to be built as a module, although it can be used from non-module code.
 
### Building

To build the library without running any tests:
```
make
```

### Testing
 
To build the library and run all unit tests:
```
make test
```

The tests expect you to have DynamoDB running locally. One way to do this is with Docker:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
```
